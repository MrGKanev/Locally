# Locally

So yes it is another Docker based system. I used something else before but it was too mainstream so i build my own. 

## Getting Started
If you feel I am missing interesting things, put it on the [issues](https://github.com/mrgkanev/locally/issues) and I'll definitely try it out.


### Prerequisites

- An OS
- Docker
- Git


### Installing

Start:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Stop:

```bash
$ docker-compose stop
```



End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Example



## Deployment

For now it is easy.
